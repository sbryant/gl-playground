gl-playground
=============

A skeleton for playing around in OpenGL.

Building
========

* Make sure you have SDL and SDL_image installed.
* Make sure you have GLEW installed.
* Make sure you have glfw 3.x installed.
* Make sure you have pkg-config installed

`make` and a playground executable will be built.

* Right now this only supports OS X but adding other platforms should be easy enough.
